Gabryel is doing a PhD in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, supervised by Professor [Mark Sandler](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/profiles/sandlermark.html) and Professor [Primoz Skraba](http://pskraba.org/), researching the Theory of Deep learning in the aim to make Deep Learning more explainable and interpretable. Gabryel also works one day a week in a contract role with the Rosalind Franklin Institute, working on object storage first science. Gabryel is a Google 2023 Academic Scholar and has published work at the main conference of ICLR and the Sci4DL workshop at NeurIPS.

Before getting into the Theory of Deep Learning, Gabryel primarily worked on High-Performance Computing and Storage and, within this area, gave many talks at conferences on this research such as CIUK, cloud-sig and Ceph days.
